## 🤦‍♂️ Background:

[Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code?view=vs-2022)

Mistakes were made along the way and I wanted to complete it so fast.

At first it failed.

I was too excited to speed through the walk through, I made a rushed mistake which caused the test results not to match the results of the instructions.


## 😎 What's Next:
